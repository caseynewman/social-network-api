# Social Network API

## Description

The Social Network API was built for users to share their thoughts, friend other users, and post reactions to other users' thoughts. The application allows users to connect with other people and share what's on their mind.

In building this project, I learned how powerful NOSQL databases can be in certain circumstances. I learned how to create models and routes for Mongo, using Mongoose. I gained an understanding of virtuals as well as getters and setters.

## Installation

Mongo, Mongoose, and Express are needed for this project. I also imported Day.js to format the createdAt dates within the Thought model. To run the application, type 'node server' in the integrated terminal.

## Usage

The Social Network API allows users to create an account with a username and their email address. They can update their account information, post thoughts, reactions to other users' thoughts, and friend other users on the application. They can delete their reactions and their thoughts at any time. If they choose to delete their account, it will delete all thoughts they've had as well. Users can see how many friends they have and remove friends at any time. They can also see the number of reactions associated with each thought.
